1. Need to establish links between nodes in the navigation panel tree to their child nodes/collections.
2. Need to work out how to make the tree react to loading of collections under a database node - to create a new CollectionsView.
   This might need us to define some custom events that get fired when the collections are loaded.
3. Need to fire some kind of model selection event when a detail view is rendered and react to it in the tree by
   highlighting the selected node.
